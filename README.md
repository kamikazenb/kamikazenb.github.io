## My portfolio

### Dissertation thesis

> #python #AI #NeuralNetworks #XAI #LCS

Originally, I started with the theme **"Soft computing techniques for data mining and Big data analysis"** but during my study, I found a new, interesting direction in academic research, and that's **#XAI (eXplainable Aritifial Inteligence)**, which focuses on how to explain how AI (NN, ensemble, SVM...) is creating decisions. In my academic research, I want to use **#LCS (Learning Classifier System)** to create an new interpretable method for CNN.

**Possibilities of Real-time Application Data Syncing on the Android Mobile Platfrom**

This diploma thesis focuses on possibilities to synchronize data between applications for the Android mobile platform via a dedicated server. In the theoretical part, the thesis clarifies the concept of real-time synchronization and its use and then provides an overview of creating applications for the Android mobile platform. In the last chapter of the theoretical part, the thesis describes the possibilities of data syncing from the point of view of network connection, focusing on socket programming, web services and databases in real time. In the following practical part is created a design of an application syncing data using various techniques. The design is implemented and tested, while data is collected. These are evaluated and the individual techniques are compared in terms of complexity, applicability together with their advantages and disadvantages.

### Mathematical optimization

> #C# #.NET #metahuristic #sofcomputing #EvolutionaryAlgorithm

This was interesting school project to create implementation of RANDOM SEARCH, LOCAL SEARCH, STOCHASTIC HILL CLIMER, SIMULATED ANNEALING and DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION to solve test funcionts like De Jong 1, De Jong 2 and Schwefel. I've created TABU SEARCH to solve symetric travelling salesman problem. Example instances can be found [here](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/XML-TSPLIB/instances/)

Programs plus builds (somewhere debug, somewhere release) and plus documentations can be found [here](https://github.com/kamikazenb/kamikazenb.github.io/blob/master/src/optimalization.zip) (layout with documentation is for now in Slovak language)

### Web sites

> #web #javascript #typescript #php #bootstrap #wordpress

I started to use Angular, but in the meantime came Svelte, which was a game changer and the new way to create larger websites. Here are some examples, which I created in pure HTML, JS, and CSS. Svelte is on the way.
